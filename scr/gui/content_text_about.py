Description
-----------
In daily engineer's work you sometimes need create simply or a bit more advanced calculations and embed them in to master report (which is Word, PDF or other format file). tuxCalc allow to create plain text including mathematical expressions. Math expressions are automatically updated. You can force expressions update manually or switch into dynamic update as you write the text. So all you need to have your simple dynamic calculation content is just plain text so you can copy-paste it where you need after all. Please note that this app is at early stage.
